### Readme: Rladies Nijmegen intro graphs. Laurel Brehm, 20ish June 2018

These were created based upon a google survey!  The original headings from the export from google can be found in Rladies-origheadings.txt.  

The main data are in the RLadiesNijmegenintroductionsurve-Deidentified. Some columns (comments mostly) were removed from this, because I felt that it made the respndent identity potentially obvious.
The columns with more than one answer have been saved as separate sheeds (HelpR, OtherSoftware, Packages, WhatR and WhatSee). This is convenient for summarizing but also preserves RLadies identies.

The script R_ladies_graphs.R calls the various data files in this folder to make graphs (saved in Plots).  The plots might need some fussing with window size & I fixed labels with Adobe.
